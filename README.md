## Module EKS | Kubernetes ☸️
Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS) is a popular managed Kubernetes service that simplifies the deployment and management of containerized applications on AWS. To streamline the process of provisioning an EKS cluster and automate infrastructure management, developers and DevOps teams often turn to tools like Terraform, Terragrunt, and GitHub Actions

🧱 Core Components
```
✅ Write Terraform code for building blocks
✅ Write Terragrunt code to provision infrastructure
✅ Create a GitHub Actions workflow and delegate the infrastructure provisioning task to it.
✅ Add a GitHub Actions workflow job to destroy our infrastructure when we're done.
```


🔌 Native Integration
